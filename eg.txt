aS'Commissioners\n\nin Lunacy.\n\nit\n\nis indeed more apparent\n\n11\na\nonly increased from 4065 to 4671, or about 15 per cent;\nfact which they justly consider confirmative of their opinion,\nthe increase of insanity is in a great degree to be attri\nthat\nbuted to its having become more completely and generally\nrecognized, and that\nthan real.\nThe Commissioners make some judicious and humane remarks\nupon the practice which has sprung up, of sending insane per\nsons to county lunatic asylums, who are far removed from the\ncondition of paupers;\nthe transaction being effected by arrange\nment between the relatives of the patient and the Parochial\nOfficers. This has been a cause of complaint, because it tends\nto pre-occupy the asylum accommodation intended for the true\npauper lunatic; but the Commissioners think that the statuary\ndefinition of pauper, as " every person maintained wholly, or\nin part by, or chargeable to any union or county,"\nseems to\ncountenance,\nif it does not justify the practice ; and they think\nthat the prevention of this practice would often lead the rela\ntives, who would otherwise contribute to the support of such\nto throw themselves and the patient entirely upon\npatient,\nthe parochial funds.\nThere is much justice in these obser\nappears\nvations,\nbut\nto us an\nis certainly one\nevasion of the spirit of the statute ; and it\nwhich, unless watched, may creep into a great and glaring\nshouldered\nabuse.\nalready\nthe\nmiddle classes out of many of the charitable\nof\ninstitutions\nthe country, and it would now seem that\nthere is some pro\nbability that\nthis kind of encroachment will go one step\nlower, and that when disease and distress overtake members\nof the middle class, they will not disdain to eat the bread of\nthe pauper.\nto which the abuse above\nreferred to may be carried, we may mention that we once\nourselves admitted a girl of 18 as a pauper\ninto a\ncounty asylum, whose father was worth a hundred thousand\npounds, and who was herself an heiress\nto the amount of\nten thousand. Her miserly father brought her to the asylum\nstrapped down to a seat, in an open cart, and with a straight\nwaistcoat on. She happily recovered, and rode away from\nyoung\nthe pauper\nlady in Rotten Row.\nin\nremoving no inconsiderable\ninsane poor from\nworkhouses to county asylums, and they conclude with the\nfollowing observation.\n" If all these considerations are taken into account, it will\n" excite little\nefforts which of\n\nThe Commissioners also refer to their own exertions\n\ninstitution in the style of an equestrian\n\nAs an instance of the extent\n\nsurprise that\n\nthe strenuous\n\nthe practice, nevertheless,\n\nThe upper\n\nclasses have\n\nlunatic,\n\nnumber of\n\n\x0c'

aS'Ninth Report of the\n\nthat\n\nsurprised at\n\nthe great number of\n\nlunatic poor\n\na large and every year\nand\n\nprobably\n\nhopeless, cases\n\nThe Commissioners consider\n\nare only "to a limited extent\n\n12\n\' late years have been made in England to provide for the\n\' insane poor in public asylums, should have been unable to\n\'keep pace with the growing demand for such provision,\n\' and that\naugmenting mass of\nbecome\n\' chronic,\nshould\n\' accumulated in these institutions, occupying much of the\n\' available accommodation there,\nit\nis to\nto the exclusion,\n\' be feared, of many other cases,\nto which, as being of\ntreatment would be most\n\' recent date, the earliest remedial\n\' important.\nNotwithstanding\nin\nasylums,\nthe Commissioners estimate the number of insane\nrelief, and not in asylums, at no\npersons receiving parochial\nfewer than 10,500, of whom about one half are detained in\nworkhouses, and one half are living at\nlarge with relatives\nor strangers.\nthis large\nnumber of lunatics\nunder\n" their cognizance." We are somewhat\nthis\navowal, as it is perfectly obvious that no class of the insane\npoor stand so much in need of the cognizance of the Com\nmissioners\nas this does. Once placed in an\nasylum,\nthe insane pauper is under the protection of a staff\nof responsible officers and a board of visiting justices, and\ncertainly stands less in need of the cognizance of the Com\nmissioners in Lunacy,\nin proportion to the amount of care\nand protection thus afforded. But it is notorious that\nthe in\nsane poor that are confined in workhouses are protected from\ncruelty and ill treatment\nin no such manner ; neglect\nindeed\nmust necessarily be their lot, for the Union Houses have no\nclass of persons charged with, or responsible for their care.\nThe functionaries\ngenerally consist of\nand\nthe master and matron,\nthe porter, cook, schoolmaster,\ninfirmary nurse ; these have their hands\nfull of their own\npeculiar duties, and the charge of any insane inmates\nfalls\ninmates, who may fairly be\nto the lot of the other pauper\nexcused for objecting to the aggravation of their privations\nof wretched and\nand confinement, by the companionship\nmindless beings whose habits\nare too often offensive and\ndisgusting by day and destructive of repose by night.\nis\nthe sane inmates of union houses\nnot\nshould be remarkable for their good sense, humanity, or for\nthey form one class of the out\nbearance. On the contrary,\ncompanions are not\ncasts of society, and if their\nabsolutely\nit\nthey should some\ncertainly is not\ntimes use very harsh measures\nthe quietude of\n\npersecuted by them out of mere malignity,\n\nto be wondered at, that\n\nto prevent\n\nto be expected that\n\nIt\n\nlunatic\n\nin Lunacy\n\nof such institutions\n\n\x0c'

We\nentertain however\nfaith in the harmlessness of such\nimbeciles, believing that a large proportion of the catastro-\nphies which have arisen from the violence of persons of\nunsound mind, have been caused by individuals of this class.\nPerhaps this fact, which the records of criminal\njustice will\namply illustrate, may be explained\nby their being more\nsubject\nto persecution and annoyance, and by their receiving\nsupervision than any other class of insane\nless systematic\npersons.

Bnt\nit may also originate after birth, when\ninjudicious diet, uncleanlincss, mental neglect,\nbesides the miasma, brandy,\nwet. damp, dark dwellings, marriage of relation?, hereditary, want of snn and\nair, may be causes. The sporadic cretenism may also be hereditary, but\nit\ncommences later. The same influences may occasion,it, but also pure bodily\ndisease, particularly of the brain, may the cause. Amongst\nthe prophylactic\nmeasures are those for the prevention of miasma, and for obviating the\nabove named evils.\nthe Institution for\nFirst Report of\nSaxony.\nThis is the Report of the first Government\n\nIdiots at Hiibertsberg,\ninstitution for idiot children\nin Germany. The method is given in which instruction is imparted, being\nthe first time the subject has been made public by a master;\nthey have\nhitherto, as it appears, made a secret of it. Although in general we agree\nwith the view of Herr Glasche, still his method suggests thoughts, and induces\nus to observe what has been so frequently remarked of those who instruct\nidiots,\nas though possessed of sense, or as\ndeaf and dumb children.\nThere is a great difference between the two\nsystems, and I\nthat\nthink that\nit has not been advantageous\nthe teachers of the deaf and dumb have felt themselves especially called upon\nto dcvclope the minds of these children; with the deaf and dumb we never\nreach the brain by the ear, but through the other senses, which mnst supply the\nplace of the ear; with the idiot, however, we make use of the ear, which we\nmust acutely devclope and work with. The means of instruction of the deaf and\ndumb are not connected with the ear, but with the other senses;\nthose for\nidiots are especially for the ear. Another circumstance which I must censure,\nand which is based npon this false view, is the use of pantomine in the education\nof idiots. Pantomime can be applicable only where speech fails and where a\nready idea must be expressed; but where ideas fail, but speech, even if only\nrudimental, can be used (and this latter with idiot children may be always\nobtained), then I do not know of what use the pantomime can be.\nincluded, forty-five pupils since the com\nmencement of the establishment, have been treated;\nthirteen have been re\nmoved, two have died, and thirty remain. Of the thirteen dismissed, seven\nreceived confirmation in the establishment; and thereupon the author makes a\nnumber of explanatory observations.\nI infer from the regulations in the fourth\ndivision, that\nthe yearly expences amount to 24 dollars if the relatives pay, and\nto 12 dollars if paid by the parish.\n\nThe author observes that,\n\nto idiots\n\nall\n\nthat\n\nthey treat\n\nthem rather\n\nJ.

The means of instruction of the deaf and\ndumb are not connected with the ear, but with the other senses;\nthose for\nidiots are especially for the ear. Another circumstance which I must censure,\nand which is based npon this false view, is the use of pantomine in the education\nof idiots. Pantomime can be applicable only where speech fails and where a\nready idea must be expressed; but where ideas fail, but speech, even if only\nrudimental, can be used (and this latter with idiot children may be always\nobtained), then I do not know of what use the pantomime can be.\nincluded, forty-five pupils since the com\nmencement of the establishment, have been treated;\nthirteen have been re\nmoved, two have died, and thirty remain.

The method is given in which instruction is imparted, being\nthe first time the subject has been made public by a master;\nthey have\nhitherto, as it appears, made a secret of it. Although in general we agree\nwith the view of Herr Glasche, still his method suggests thoughts, and induces\nus to observe what has been so frequently remarked of those who instruct\nidiots,\nas though possessed of sense, or as\ndeaf and dumb children.\nThere is a great difference between the two\nsystems, and I\nthat\nthink that\nit has not been advantageous\nthe teachers of the deaf and dumb have felt themselves especially called upon\nto dcvclope the minds of these children; with the deaf and dumb we never\nreach the brain by the ear, but through the other senses, which mnst supply the\nplace of the ear; with the idiot, however, we make use of the ear, which we\nmust acutely devclope and work with. The means of instruction of the deaf and\ndumb are not connected with the ear, but with the other senses;\nthose for\nidiots are especially for the ear. Another circumstance which I must censure,\nand which is based npon this false view, is the use of pantomine in the education\nof idiots. Pantomime can be applicable only where speech fails and where a\nready idea must be expressed; but where ideas fail, but speech, even if only\nrudimental, can be used (and this latter with idiot children may be always\nobtained), then I do not know of what use the pantomime can be.\nincluded, forty-five pupils since the com\nmencement of the establishment, have been treated;\nthirteen have been re\nmoved, two have died, and thirty remain.
